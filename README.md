Current state after Sandbox 2:

	- Working slicing of head and tails to shorten the dataset within the the hydrological year.
	- Wrongly slices if 01.09 and 31.08 is NaN value, then it removes the entire year. 
		- Fix this later on and discuss how to interpolate, linear seems best. 
		- Ask for what would be considered small range and what is sufficient to remove entire year.
